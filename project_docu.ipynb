    "#  **1. What is the goal of the project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to develop an interactive flashcard application called \"Flash Genius\" to facilitate learning and memorization through repetitive practice. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for creating and learning flashcards on various topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the learner should be able to add new flashcards. The application should save learning progress after each step, allowing the learner to resume from where they left off in the next session. This means that the application will keep track of which flashcards have been reviewed and which ones still need to be learned. However, the learner should also have the option to reset their learning progress and start from scratch. Furthermore, the learner should be able to exit the program at any time."

    "# **2. Roadmap to Reach the Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a group, we initially created a **chart diagram** to outline the project's structure and agreed on the fundamental features required for the application. This initial planning phase helped us identify key components and establish a clear vision for \"Flash Genius.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we focused intensively on **how to handle data** for the flashcards and how to save learning progress effectively. This involved detailed discussions and planning to ensure that the application would be both functional and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these initial steps, we proceeded with **designing and implementing deck management**. We created a Deck class to manage the flashcard decks, which handles loading, saving, and manipulating deck data stored in a JSON file. This ensures that users can easily create and manage their flashcards within the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next phase involved **developing the learning logic**. We implemented a LearnTopic class to manage the learning process, including selecting flashcards, tracking progress, and updating flashcard scores based on user responses. This class is crucial for providing an effective and personalized learning experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then moved on to **building the user interface**. Using tkinter, we designed and developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes the main menu, topic selection, flashcard display, and progress tracking. The GUI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing learners to navigate the application with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we integrated all components of the application and **conducted thorough testing** to ensure smooth and reliable operation. This integration and testing phase is essential to identify and resolve any issues, ensuring that \"Flash Genius\" delivers a seamless learning experience.\n"

    "Overall, we are pleased that we were able to develop a basic program for flashcards. For all of us, it was the first time programming such a project. Integrating the JSON files and implementing a GUI were particularly challenging for us. Despite our achievements, there are several areas that need improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Interface**: Creating an intuitive and responsive GUI that enhances the user experience was an essential goal. While our current GUI is functional, there is potential for further refinement to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting Topics or Flashcards**: Currently, there is no function to delete topics or individual flashcards. Adding this functionality would greatly enhance the usability of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Displaying Learned Flashcards**: It would be useful to have a feature that shows which flashcards from a topic have been learned. This would give users a clearer sense of their progress within each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session Statistics**: At present, users can only view statistics for a learning session with a single topic. A potential enhancement would be to provide statistics for the entire learning session when the user exits the program, offering a comprehensive overview of their learning progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we could improve our collaboration methods for future projects. Many of us had not worked with Git before, but using it would have made collaboration during the project much easier. Adopting Git for version control and collaboration can streamline our workflow, reduce conflicts, and ensure that all team members are up-to-date with the latest changes."
